Modern agriculture has come a long way, with many technologies and tools to prevent issues in farming and maximize profits. Some of these tools can be detrimental to the environment though, with chemicals such as herbicides, fungicides, etc. effecting our plants and soil. 

This is why I created this project, which uses a [dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/plant_village) of over 54,000 images of 38 different classes of 38 classes of varying leaves, and 14 different species of plants (Apple, Blueberry, Cherry, Corn, Grape, Orange, Peach, Bell Pepper, Potato, Raspberry, Soybean, Squash, Strawberry, and Tomato).

## Project Details

####  Model Summary

## Technologies Used
I used 5 key technologies :

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - open source library used for machine learning
* [Google Coral DevBoard](https://coral.ai/products/dev-board/) - single board computer mainly used for running machine learning models, most important aspect is the [TPU](https://www.assured-systems.com/us/news/article/google-edge-tpu---what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work/)
* [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) - minimal version of conda, an environment manager
* [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip) - python package installer and management tool
* [PlantVillage](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/plant_village) - Dataset used for ML model training, validation, and testing


##### Other key technologies used include:

* [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) - single board computer used as host for setting up DevBoard
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - IDE used for development


#### More technologies will be added in the future as more features are added
